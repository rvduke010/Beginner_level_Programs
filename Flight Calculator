# Your task is to go through all the routes in a loop and check how many of them lead to Rome 
(i.e. how many of them have city_to equal to 'Rome'). 
Among the routes to Rome, you should also calculate the average flight time.
Print the following the output:
{} connections lead to Rome with an average flight time of {} minutes

Replace {} with the number of connections and the average flight time.
# given value is Connection
connections = [
    ('Amsterdam', 'Dublin', 100),
    ('Amsterdam', 'Rome', 140),
    ('Rome', 'Warsaw', 130),
    ('Minsk', 'Prague', 95),
    ('Stockholm', 'Rome', 190),
    ('Copenhagen', 'Paris', 120),
    ('Madrid', 'Rome', 135),
    ('Lisbon', 'Rome', 170),
    ('Dublin', 'Rome', 170),]

count=0
amt=0
for i in connections:
    # print(i[1],i[2])
    if(i[1]=="Rome"):
        # print("yes",i[1],i[2])
        count=count+1
        amt=amt+i[2]

avg=amt/count
# print(avg)

print(count,"connections lead to Rome with an average flight time of",avg,"minutes")
